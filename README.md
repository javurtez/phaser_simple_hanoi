## How to Build the Site
To build this project you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

Next run `npm install` in the root directory to install the various dependencies.

Run `npm run build` after modifying code to populate the **public** directory with the final site contents. You can instead run `npm run build-dev` to build the JavaScript in development mode, or `npm run start:dev` to run an automatically updating instance.

If you'd like to run a simple web server, install http-server via `npm install http-server -g`, which can then be run from the public directory by running `http-server`.

If you'd like to lint your TypeScript/JavaScript, run `npm run lint`.

## Upgrading Phaser
To upgrade Phaser 3 run `npm upgrade phaser`.
